						About this Resource
						Indivior Inc. (Indivior) is required to disclose the following requirements for participation and use to all participants. This free service provides a list of physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants (hereafter collectively and individually referred to as HCP(s) or Healthcare Providers) who are waivered per the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 to provide treatment with SUBLOCADE and who have agreed to be in the Indivior Treatment Locator (Locator).

						
							The maximum number of patients that an HCP may treat is limited by law; therefore, some HCPs may not always be able to accept new patients.
							Participating HCPs do not pay a fee to be listed in the Locator, and their participation does not impose any requirements on the manner in which they treat or provide services to patients.
							Participating HCPs are chosen for your search based on the geographical search information entered.
							Some of the participating HCPs may be consultants to Indivior and receive payment for services. Some may have other financial relationships with Indivior as recipients of research grants, or other similar payments, or they may have an ownership interest in Indivior.
							HCPs may request to be removed from the Locator and Indivior retains the right to remove HCPs from the Locator for the following reasons:
								
									The HCP's contact information is no longer valid;
									The HCP's DATA 2000 waiver or medical license, healthcare provider license or state prescribing license is suspended, revoked, or restricted;
									The HCP is not in compliance with DATA 2000 and its implementing regulations; or
									The company has information or determines after investigation that the HCP may be engaging in the unsafe prescription of our products
								
							
						
						
						Limitation of Indivior Liabilities
						Indivior does not warrant, whether expressed or implied, that the Locator is accurate or complete. Indivior does not recommend or endorse any HCP included in the Locator for any purpose, nor is the Locator a tool to verify a specific HCP's credentials or qualifications. It is your responsibility to select an HCP appropriate for your needs and you assume full responsibility for your interactions with any HCP you contact through the Locator. Indivior is not responsible for the medical care or advice given by any participating HCP you choose to contact.
						Do you acknowledge that you understand how the Locator works and that you'd like to continue to your results?
